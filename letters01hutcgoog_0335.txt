their ever having been reversed. It was asserted,
however, that these people were released upon
their petition to the proconsuIS, or their lieutenants;
which seems likely enough to be the truth‚ as it is
improbable any person should have dared to set ,
them at liberty without authority. ¹

Tanau To Pnuv

We are to remember that you were sent into
Bithynia for the particular purpose of correcting
those many abuses with which it appeared to be
over-run. Now none stands more in need of re-
formation, than that convicts should not only be set at
liberty (as your letter informs me) without authority ;
but actually restored to the station of respectable
officials Those therefore among them who have
been convicted within these teu years, and whose
sentence has not been reversed by proper authority,
must be sent back again to their respective punish-
ments: but where more than ten years have elapsed
since their conviction, and they are grown old and
infirm, let them be distributed in such employments
as approach penal servitude3 that is, either to ·
attend upon the public baths, cleanse the common
sewers, or repair the streets and highwayS, the
usual offices to which such persons are assigned.
