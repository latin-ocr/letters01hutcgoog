surprised to find from your letter that there are
some who disapprove of my reciting ¹speculas at all;
l cannot guess why, unless, indeed, they think a
speech the one form of composition that ought not
to be corrected I would willingly ask theru why
they allow (if indeed they do allow) that History
may be recited, since it rs written 1n the interests
of truth and honesty‚ not for display? Or why
Tragedy, when it requires a stage and actors, not an
audience-hall? Or Lyric Poetry, which requires not
a reader, buta chorus and a harp-accompaniment?

They will rejoin that in the instances mentioned,
recitation has become established by custom. Well,
we are not therefore, 1 suppose, to condemn the
person who first introduced the practice? However,
Ι need not labour this point, for certain of our own
orators, and the Greeks generally, have been in
the habit of reciting their speeches. “But it is
superfluouS,'’ says someone, “to recite a speech
which has already been delivered.'' YeS, if you
recite it exactly as delivered, to the very same
audience, and immediately; but if you make several
additions and alterations3 if you collectan audience
composed partly of the same, and partly of different
persons, and after an interval, why is it less plausible
to recite your speech than to publish it? As to the
difficulty they may allego of giving satisfaction by
the mere recital of a speech, tlrot is simply a question
of how much trouble the reciter takes, and no
¹argument against reciting m general.

For my part, itis not whilst Ι am reciting hut
whilst I am read, that Ι would be applauded3
accordingly Ι omit no method of correction. ln the
first place, Ι revise my composition in private, next l
