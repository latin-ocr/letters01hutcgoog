Augustus to the estate of every citizen who dies‘
intestate. You will *therefore summon the several
parties interested in this question, and with the
assistance of Epimachus and Virdius Gemellinus, my
Procurators (having duly weighed every argument
that shall be alleged against the claim), determine
