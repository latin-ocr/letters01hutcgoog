BOOK Vll. ix

selves, or rather did both. The mind is surprisingly
entertained and enlivened by these little composi-
tions, for they turn' upon subjects of gallantry,
antipathies, quarrels, pity, politenesS, and everything,
in short, that concerns daily life and even the forensic
sphere. Besides, the same advantage attends these
as every other sort of poems; that we delight in
prose alter being fettered by numbers, and more
³ villingly employ what comparison shows to be the
. easier form of composition.

And now, perhaps, l have more than satisfied your
demands3 however, there rs one thing which Ι have
omitted: I have not told you what books Ι think
you should read, though indeed, that was implied by
my telling you what you should write. Pray remem-
berto select with care the standard authors on each
subject3 for, as the saying is, “though we should
read much, we should not read many books.” Who
those authors are is so clearly settled, and so
generally known, that l need not point them out to
you; besides, I have already extended this letter to
such an immoderate length, that I have curtailed the
time, by recommending the course, of you'r studies.
Baek, then, to your writing-tablets, and either write »
something from the hints l have now given you,
or continue the composition on which you were
already engaged. Farewell.
