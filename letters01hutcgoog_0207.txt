the lake. This follows the gentle curve of a single
bay: the salient ridge upon which the other stands,
forms two. Here you have a straight alley
extending itself along the shore, there, a spacious
terrace that falls by a gentle desceut towards it.
The former does not perceive the force of the waves;
the latter breaks them: from that you see the
fishermeu at work below; from iliis you may fish
yourself, and throw your line out of your chamber,
and almost as you lie in bed, as out of a boat. Itis
the beauties therefore these agreeable villas possess,
that tempt me to add to them those which are
wanting-But Ι need not assign a reason to you ;
who, undoubtedly, will think it a sufficient one that
you are about the same business. Farewell.

To Aucuruuus

Wnnu Ι to begin praising you from whom 1 have
received so much applause, Ι am afraid Ι should
seem not so much to profess my genuine opinion as
to confess my gratitudo. Nevertheless I will not
scruple to say, that Ι think all your productioris are
beautiful, but especially those of which l am the
subject. And the same reason will account both for
their deserving that character, aud for my thinking
so: for as ou the oue hand you ever succeed best
when writing about your friends; s0, on the other,
lalways admire most what is written about myself.
Farewell.
