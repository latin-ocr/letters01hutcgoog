To Tun Enrunon Tnarsu

Wuuu Ι was making a progress ln a different
partos the province, a prodIgious lire broke out at
Nicomedia, which not only consumed several private
houses‚ but also two ' public buildings, the old men's
hospicel and the temple of Isis, though they stood
on contrary sides of the street. The occasion oi Its
spreading thus far was partly owing to the violence
of the wind, and partly to the Indolence of the people,
who, l am well assured, stood fixed and idle spectators
of this terrible calamity. And at any rate, the city
was not provided either with a single engine or bucket
or any one instrument proper to extinguish fires;
these however will be got ready, as l have already
ordered. Pray determine, Sir, whether you think it
well to institute a guild of lire-men, not to exceed
one hundred and fifty members Ι will take care
none but those of that calling shall be admitted into
it; and that the privileges granted them shall not
be diverted to any other purpose. As they will be
so few, it will be easy enough to keep them under
proper regulation.

You are of opinion it would be proper to constitute
a guild of fite-men in Nicomedia, agreeably to what
has been practised in several other places. But it
‘¹ Several citios are known to have had these institutione,

which provIded common maala and a common resort for aged
citizens elected to memborahip.
