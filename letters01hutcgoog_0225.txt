uproar was renewed. In the interval the Consul put

a division, dismissed the Senate, leaving Veiento
in the midst, still attempting to speak. He

made great complaints of this affront (as he

“ Great perils, father, wait th' unequal light ;
Those younger champions will oppress thy might.'’

praises They extolled me because, at the risk of
exciting private animosities, l had revived the
custom so ,long disused, of consulting the Senate in
the interest of the public⁶3 in fine, because l had
wiped off that reproach which was thrown upon the
Senate by the other orders of citizens that
while severe towards the rest of the community,
it let its own members escape its justice by a sort of
mutual connivance.
