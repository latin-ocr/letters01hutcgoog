BOOK X. iv

(my school-fellow and early companion) claims the
first rank in¹ that number; in consequence of which
Ι petitioned your sacred Father to promote him to
the dignity of the Senatorial order. But the corn-
pletion of my request is reserved to your goodness3
for his mother had not then executed a deed of gift
of the four millions of sesterces which she engaged
to give him, in her petition to the Emperor your
late father ε a this, however, on a reminder from me
she has since done, having realized a sufficient estate
in land, with all the necessary formalities

The difficulties therefore being removed which
deferred our wishes, it is with full confidence Ι
venture to assure you of the merit of my friend
Romanus, heightened and adorned as it is, not only
by the liberal and polite arta, but by his extra-
ordinary tenderness to his parents Itis to that
virtue he owes the present liberality of his mother;
as well as his immediate succession to his late
father’s estate, and his having been adopted by his
stepfather. To these persona] qualifications the

wealth and rank of his family· give an increase of Α

lustre3 as Ι persuade myself it will be some
additional recommendation to your favour, that Ἰ
solicit in his behalf. Let me then intreat you, Sir,
to put it in my power to congratulate Romanus, on
an occasion so highly agreeable to me; and at the
same time to gratify an eager, and l hope a laudable
ambition of being able to boast, that your favourable
regards are extended not only to myself, but also to
my friend.

⁶ Property to the velue ol l,200‚000 sesterces was a
necessary qualification for senatorial rank.
