Yon, who are upon the spot, will best be able to
consider and determine what is proper to be done
concerning the theatre, which the Nicaeans have
begun3 as for myself, it will be sufficient if you let
me know your decision. lt will be time enough for
you to exact fulfilment of private undertakings with
regard to parts of the theatre, when the main
building is finished. These paltry Greeks, Ι know,
have a foible for Gymnasia ; hence, perhaps, the
citizens of Nicaea have been somewhat too ambitious
in planning one; but they must be contented with
such a one as will be sufficient to answer their
occasions.

You must decide for yourself how best to advise
the Claudiopolitani with reference to their bath,
which they have placed, it seemS, in a very
improper situation. As there is no province that is ·
not furnished with architects of skill and ingenuity,
you cannot possibly be in want of one; pray do not
imagine it is your quickest way to get thern from
Rome, for it is usually from Greece that they come
hither.
