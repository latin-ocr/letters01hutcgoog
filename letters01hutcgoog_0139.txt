Wnnu l consider that you love your brother's
daughter with a more than maternal fondness„ l see
I ought to give you my latest news first3 that sen-
timents of joy may forestall and preclude anxiety.

gratulation you will feel some renewal of concern,
and in the¹ midst of your joy for the danger she has
escaped, will tremble at the thought of that which

’ she has undergone. She is now, however, in good

recovery, as she did towards her late danger. To
tell you the truth, she was in the utmost danger (be
