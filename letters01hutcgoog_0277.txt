BOOK IX. xxxv-xxxvi

XXXV

To Armua

Ι nava received your book, and return you thanks
for it; butam at present so much engaged, that Ι
have not time to read it; which, however, l impa-
tiently wish to do. Ι have that high revcrcnce for
letters in general, and for your compositions in
particular, that l think it a sort os profanation to
approach them but with a mind entirely disengaged.
Ι extremely approve of your care in revising your
works3 remember, however, this exactness has its
limits: too much polishing rather weakeus than
strengthens a performance. Besides, this excessive
delicacy, while it calls one off from other pursuits,
not only prevents any new attempts, but does not
even finish what it has begun. Farewell.

To Fuscus

You desire to know in what manner Ι dispose of
my day in summer-time at my Tuscan villa.

Ι rise just when Ι find myself in the humour,
hough generally with the sun; osten indeed sooner,
but seldom later, When 1 am up, I continue to keep
he shutters os my chamber-windows closed. For
under the influence of darkness and silence, l find
myself wonderfully free and abstracted from those
utward objects which dissipate attention, and left to
ny own thoughts3 nor do 1 suffer my mind to
ander with my eyes, but keep my eyes in subjection
