deferred passing sentence till l had conferred with
you, the glorious founder, and firm support of military
discipline, concerning the punishment proper to be
inflicted upon them. My principal doubt is, that
though they have taken the military oath, they are
not yet entered into any particular legion. 1 beg
therefore, Sir, you would let me know what method
l shall pursue, especially as it is an affair in which
example is concerned.

Sempronius Caelianus has acted agreeably to my
orderS, in sending those persons to you for trial,
the capital nature of whose offense must be decided
by investigation. lt is material, in the case in
question, to inquire, whether these slaves enlisted
themselves voluntarily, or were enrolled by the
recruiting officerS, or presented as proxies for others.
If they were enrolled, the officer is guilty3 if they
are proxieS, the blame rests with those who deputed
them; but if, conscions of the legal inabilities of
their station, they presented themselves voluntarily,
the punishment must fall upon their own heads
That they are not yet entered into any legion
makes no great difference in their case3 for they
ought to have given a true account of themselves
immediately, upon their being approved as fit for
the service.
