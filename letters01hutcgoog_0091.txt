calling for a light, together with his pen and
anhleta, he directed all his people to retire within.
But that his mind might not, for want of employ-
ment‚-be open to the vain terrors of imaginary
noises and apparitions, he applied himself to writing
with all his faculties The first part of the night
passed with usual silence, then began the clanking
of iron fetters3 however, he neither lifted up his
eyes, nor laid down his pen, but closed his ears by
concentrating his attention. The noise increased
and advanced nearer, till it seemed at the door,
and at last in the chamber. He looked round and
saw the apparition exactly as it had been described
to him: it stood before him, beckoning with the
finger. Athenodorus made a sign with his hand
that it should wait a little, and bent again to his
writing, but the ghost rattliug its chains over his
¹ head as he wrote, he looked round and saw it
beckoning as before. Upon this he immediately
took up his lamp and followed it. The ghost slowly
stalked along, as if encumbered with its drains;
and having turned into the courtyard of the house,
suddenly vanished. Athenodorus being thus
deserted, marked the spot with a handful of grass
and leaves. The next day he went to the

and intertwined with chains3 for the body had
mouldered away by long lying in the ground,
leaving them bare, and corroded by the fetters.
The bones were collected, and buried at the public
expense; and aster the ghost was thus duly laid the
, house was haunted no more.
