cttle lands for that purpose, they will probably be
neglected, as those of the public usually are. For
ny part, I cau think of no better plan than what l
adopted myself. Having undertaken to give live
hundred thousand sesterces for the maintenance of
‚jell-born boys and girls, l sold at that price to the
public agent some land of mine which was worth
onsiderably more; he reconveyed it back to me,
charged with a yearly rent of .30,000 sesterces. By
this means the principal was secured to the com-
munity, at the same time the interest was certain,
and the estate itself (as it was of much greater value
*than the rent charged upon it) was always sure of
finding atenant. '¹⁴‘
l am well aware that I have disbursed consider-
ably more than the nominal amount of my gift,
since the value of this fine estate hasbeen dimi-
nished hy the encumbrance with which it is charged.
But a man must rate public and permanent, above
private and fleeting advantages and study how to
¹ render his benefaction most useful, rather than how
he may bestow it with least expense. Farcwell.
