Ι au under a wondrous difficulty, which you must
settle. l have not, I am told, a good manner of
reading verses: my talent lying chiefly in reciting
orations, l succeed so much the worse, it seems, in
poetry. ldesign therefore, as l arn 1ο 166116 some
poems 16 my familiar friendS, to make trial of my
¹freedman for that purpose. lt is treatiug them,l
own, with familiarity, to employa person who does
not read well himself ; however, he will perform,l
know, better than l can, provided his fears do not .
disconcert him, for he is as unpractised a rcader as I
am a poet. Now the perplexing question is, how Ι
shall behave while 116 is reading; whether l shall sit
silent in a fixed and indolent posture, or follow
him as he pronounces, with my eyes, hands and
voice; a manner which some, you know, prac-
tise. But l fancy l have as little gift forpantomime
as for reading. Ι repeat it again, therefore, you
must extricate me out of this wondrous difficulty,
and write 1116 word whether you honestly think it
would be better 16 read ever so ill, than 16 practise
or omit any of the weighty cirdtmstances above-
,mentioned Farcwell.
