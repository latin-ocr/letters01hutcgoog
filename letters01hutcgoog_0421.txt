ment. There were others also possessed with the
same infatuation, but being citizens of homey l
directed them to be carried thither.

These accusations spread (as is usually the case)

from the mere fact of the matter being investigated
and several forms of the mischief came to light.
A placard was put up, without any signature, accusing
a large number of persons by name. Those who
denied they were, or had ever been, Christiana ’
who repeated after me an invocation to the Gods, .
and offered adoration, with wine and frankincense,
to your image, which l had ordered to be brought for
that purpose, together with those of the Gods, and
who finally cursed Christ—none of which actS, it is
said, those who are really Christians ean be forced
into performing-these Ι thought it proper to
discharge. Others who were named by that in-
former at first confessed themselves Christians, and
then denied it ; true, they had been of that persuasion
but they had quittcd it, some three years, others
many years, and a few as much as twenty-five years
ago. They all worshipped your statue and the images
of the Gods, and cursed Christ.

or their error, was, that they were in the habit of
meeting on a certain fixed day before it was light,
when they sang in alternate verses a hymn to
Christ, as to a god, and bound themselves by a
solemn oath, not toany wicked deedS, but never
to commit any fraud, theft or adultery‚ never to '
falsify their word, nor deny a trust when they

trial at Rome. cf. st. Paul’s “appeal to Caesar‚’' Acts xxv. ll.
