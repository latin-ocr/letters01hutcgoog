You may without religious scruple, my dear
Pliny, if the site requires it, remove the temple of ’
the Mother of the Gods to a more convenient spot.
That you can find no charter of dedication, need not
influence you; for the ground of a foreign city is not
capable of receiving that kind of consecration which
is conferred by our laws.

To rus Enrunon Tnararv

Ir is not easy, Sir, to express the joy l received,
when l heard you had, in compliance with the re-
quest of my mother-in-law a and myself, granted her
kinsman Caelius Clemens the Proconsulship of this
province aster the expiration of his Consular office3
as it is from thence Ι learn the full extent of your
beneficence towards me, which thus graciously spreads
itself through my whole family. Ι dare not pretend to
make an equal return to those obligations l so justly
owe yo'u. Ι can only therefore have recourse to
voWS, and ardently implore the Gods that l may not
be found unworthy of those favourS, which you are
continually bestowing upon me.
