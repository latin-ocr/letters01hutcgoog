milder verdict. “Still,'' they say, “those who would
condemn the accused either capitally or to banish-
ment, should be first matched against those who would
acquit them, and afterwards against each other.”
Thus as in certain public gemes one competitor is
'reserved and set apart by lot to engage with the
conqueror of the rest; so, it seems, in the Senate
there is a first and s'econd combnt, and of two motione,
the prevailing one has still a third to contend with.

How about the rule that when the first motion
proposed is carried, all the rest fall to the ground?
On what principle then can motions be simul-

To repeat this more plainly; unless those in favour
of the death-penalty immediately go over to the side
