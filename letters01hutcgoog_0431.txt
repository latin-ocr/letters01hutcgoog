Varamos Paunmus, Sir, having lest me his right
of patronage over all his freedmen,⁰⁵ except one, 1
intreat you to grant full Roman citizenship to three
of them. To desire you to extend this favour to
them all, would, Ι sear, be too unreasonable a trespass

upon your indulgence; which, as Ι have amply
experienced, Ι ought to be so much the more
cautious in troubling. The persons for whom Ι
make this request arc, C. Valerius Astraeus, C.
Valerius Dionysius, and C. Valerius Aper.

As it is very generous of you to consult the
interest of those whom Valerius Paulinus has con-
lided to your trust, ΙΙ cannot but encourage your
good intentione. Ι have meanwhile given full
Roman citizenship to those persons for whom you
requested it, aud have directed the grant to be
registered: lam ready to do the same for the rest,
whenever you shall desire me.

Roman citizens, became full citizens themselves3 falling any
one oi these three conditione they gained only the partial
citizenship known as the “Latin” franchise, aud were
called Latini Janiani *from the title oi the law in question ,
(lex thaia Norbano).
