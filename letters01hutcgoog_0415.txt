finances will bear the expense of a work so conducive
to their health and pleasure.

Tunrnu ‘ro Ptuvv

Ir a benefit society be agreeable to the laws of
the Amisenians, which they enjoy under the terrns of
the treaty‚ we cannot oppose it; especially if these
contributione ahe employed, not for the purposes of
riot and fection, but for the support of the indIgent.
In other cities however, which are subject to our laws,
I would have all societies of this nature prohibited.
