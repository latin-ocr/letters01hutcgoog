BOOK IX. xiii

All this was transacted in the absence of Certus ;
who kept out of¹ the way either because he suspected
something of the kind was on foot, or (as was said in
his excuse) that he was really indisposed. Caesar
did not, it is true, refer his case to the senates
But 1 obtained newertheless, what Ι aimed at, for
his colleague was appointed to a consulship, while
he himself was superseded. And thus, the wish
with which Ι concluded my speech, was actually ac-
complished: “,May he be obliged,” said 1, “to
renounce under a virtuous prince that reward he
received under an infamous one.”⁶

Some time after 1 reconstituted my speech as well
as Ι could, and considerably enlarged it. lt chanced
(though such an event seemed more than a co-
incidence) that a few days after Ι had published
those books, Certus was taken ill and died. Ι heard
reports that he not only imagined, but actually saw,
a figure haunting him—and the apparition was none
other than myself, threatening him with a sword.
Whether this story is true or not, Ι cannot venture
to affirm3 but with a view to pointing a moral, ’tis
important that it should be accounted true.

And here you have a letter which, if you consider
the limits of a letter, is as long as the books you have
perused. But you must blame yourself for that,
since the books did not suffice you. Farewell.
