BOOK VIII. ii

merchants, who were eager toparchase it, encour-
aged by the price it then bore, and what it was
probable it would rise to; however they were
diSappointed in their expectations. To have made
the same abatement to them all, would have been
the easy, but not the equitable, course. Now the
noblest part, according to my estimate, is to pursue
justice in one’s domestic as well as public conduct;
in minute as in great affairs; and in our own, as well
as in other men’s concerns. For if “all sins are
equal,'' ⁰ so are all meritorious actions.

Accordingly, Ι remitted to all in general one-
eighth part of the price they had agreed to give me,
that none “without my largesse might depart'’;
next, I made separate provision for those who had
invested large sums in their purchase3 since they
had not only contributed more to my profit, but lost
more heavily. To those, therefore, who had bought
to the value of more than ten thousand sesterces, I
remitted (over and beside the general and, so to
speak, public eighth) a tenth part of what they had
paid above that sum. l don’t know whether I
express myself clearly enough; sol will set out my
reckoning more plainly. Suppose a man had pur-
chased to the value of fifteen thousand sesterces, he
got back one-eighth part of that amount, plus
one-tenth of five thousand sesterces

Resides, considering that some had paid over
either large or small instalments of the purchase-
money, whilst others had pald nothing; I thought it
would be not at all fair to favour with the same
remission those who had discharged their debt in
varying proportions. To those therefore who had
made any payments, I further returned a tenth part
