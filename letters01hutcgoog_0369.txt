Wnsrv Ι cited the jurorS, sn, to attend me at a
sessIons which Ι was going to hold, flavius Archippus

claimed the privilege of being excused, as exercising
the profession of a philosopher. It was alleged by
some who were present, that he ought not so much
to be excused from that office as struck out of
the roll of jurors, and remanded back to the punish-
ment' from which he had escaped by breaking his
chains. At the same time a sentence of the Pro-
consul Velius Paullus was read, by which it appeared
that ArchIppus had been condemned to the mines
for forgery. He had nothing to produce In proof
that this sentence had ever been reversed. He
adduced‚ however, as implying his restitution, a
petition thch he presented to Domitian, together
with honorific letters from that Princo, and a decree
of the Prusensians.⁰ To these he subjoined a letter
which he had received from you; as also an edict
and a letter of your august father confirming the
grants which had been made to him by Domitian.
. For these reasons, notwithstanding other crimes
were laid to his charge, l did not think proper to

determine any thing concerning him, without first ι

consulting with you ¹in the affair, which seems to
merit your personal decision. 1 have transmitted to
you, with this letter, the documents put in by both
parties.
