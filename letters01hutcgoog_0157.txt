when l wish to Iearn whether or no these motions
should have been taken separately? My demand
was at least successful 3 nevertheless,l ask, was it
justifiable? Would you know how I succeeded in it?
The proposer of the death penalty, overcome
probably by the legality, certainly by the equity of
my demand, dropped his own motion and went over
to the proposer of exile. He was afraid, to be sure,
that if the motions were taken separately (which he
saw would anyhow be the case), those for acquittal
would have a majority. And truly, the numbers
were far greater on that side than on either of the
other two, separately counted. The consequence

authority, when they saw themselves forsaken by his

deserted, as it were, with their leader. Thus the
three motions were resolved into two; and of those
two one prevailed3 while the rejected third, as it
could not vanquish both the otherS, had only to
choose to which of the two it would yield. Farewell.
