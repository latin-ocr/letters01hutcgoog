To Msxmus

i Tun lingering disorder of a friend lately reminded
me that we are never· so virtuous as when we are in
sickness For where is the invalid who is troubled
by the promptings of avarice or of lust? Such an

one is neither a slave of love, nor covetous of
,office3 he disregards wealth, andis contented with
ever so small a portion of it, as being upon the
'point of leaving even that little. lt is then he
¹recollects there are Gods, and that he himself is
but a man3 no mortal is then the object of his
envy, his admiration, or his contempt3 and the
slanderous reports neither raise his attention nor
³feed his curiosity ; his imagination dwells upon baths
and medicina] springs. These form the sum of his
cares and prayers3 and he resolves that if he has
the luck to recover, his life shall be passed in
luxurious ease, that is, in hannless happiness.

l may therefore brIefly lay down to you and
myselfa maxim which philosophers endeavour to
inculcate at the expense of many words, and even
many volumes; nanrely, that we should bc as
virtuous in hea'lth as we resolve to be in sickness.
Farewell.
