To run Eurnuoa Taxian

Wunsr 1 was dispatching some public affairs, Sir,
in the official lodgings at Prusa near Olympus, with
an intention of leaving that city the same day, l
learned from the magistrate Asclepiades that Claudius
Eumolpus had appcaled to me. Cocceianus Dior it
scema, at a meeting of the senate desired that a
public edifice, which had been erected under his
charge, might be handedover to the city in form.
But Eumolpus acting for Flavius Archippus, insisted
that Dio should render an account of the expensos
of this work, before it was assigned to the cor-
poration; suggesting that he had not properly
executed his commission. He added that your
statue had been placed in the said building, although
the bodies of Dio's wife and son are interred there,
and petitioned that I would holda judicial inquiry
on the matter.

Upon my complying, and offering to defer my
journey, he desired a later day in order to prepare
the cause, and that I would try it in some other city.
Ι appointed the city of Nicaea3 but when l took my
seat, Eumolpus, on the plea of not being yet
sufficiently instructed, 'requested a further adjourn-
ment; Dio, on the contrary, insisted that the cause
should be heard then and there. When this point
and also the merits of the cause had been argued at
length on both sides, Ι decided to grant the
adjournment and meanwhile to advise with you in

was anative of Prusa. Sojourning at Rome, he became an
intimate friend oi the Emperor Nerva. 85
