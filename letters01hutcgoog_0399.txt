To rus Enrnnon Tanain

lr is enacted, Sir, by the provincial code which
Pompey drew up for Bithynas that no person shall
exercise any magistracy, or be admitted into the
senate, under the age of thirty. By the same law
it is provided, that those who have held a magistracy
shall be senators of course. Subsequently, however,
an edict of the Emperor Augustus permitted minor
offices to be held at the age of twenty-two. The
question therefore is, whether those who 'have held
office before the age of thirty, may be legally
admitted into the senate by the Consors, and if so,
whether by the same kind of construction they may
be admitted senators, at the age when they are
allowed to be magistrates, though they llave not
actually borne any office. A custom‚ it seems,
which has hitherto been observed, and is said
to be necessary, as it is a good deal better that
persons of noble birth should be admitted into the
senate, than those of plebeian rank.

conquest was framed by the victorious general in conjunction
with ten commissionem of senatorial rank sent from Rome
for the purpose, and was known by his name.
