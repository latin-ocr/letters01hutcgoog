successiou. For Ι would not by too copious aud too
frequent a supply, over-burthen and confound a
memory to which Ι already owe so many aeknowledg-
ments3 nor, in short, pour in such an unreasonable
quantity, as to oblige it to discharge what it had
before received, in order to retain what follows.
Farewell.

'To Russo κβ

Υου have read, it seemS, in a letter of mine?
that Virginius Rufus directed the following lines to
be inscribed upon his tomb:

“ Here Rufus lies, who raised in victory’s hour
His country, not himself, to sovran power ε ”

for which you blame him, adding that Frontinus

acted much more worthily in forbiddiug any Ι

monument whatsoever to be erected to his memory.
And in the conclusion of your letter you desire my
sentiments upon each. Ι loved them both; but l
confess l admired him most whom you condemn ;
and to such a degree, that sofar from imagining
Ι ever should have occasion to rise up in his defence,
Ithought he could never be sufficiently applauded.
ln my opinion, every man who has acted a great and
memorable part, deserves not only to be excused
but extolled, if he pursues that glorious immortality
of fame he has merited and endeavours to perpetuate
an everlasting remembrance of himself, even by an
epitaph.
