people who oblige me to act either as their judge, or ’

their arbitrator. To this l must add, not only the
complaints of the rustics, who claim to weary my
ears in virtue of my having been so long absent, but
the necessity of letting out my farms; an affair
which gives me much trouble, as itis exceedingly
‘difficolt to find proper tenants.

’ For these reasons 1 can only study by snatches;
still, however, I study. For Ι both read and
compose; but my reading teaches me, by comparison,
with what ill success Ι attempt to be an author
myself. Though indeed you give me great en-
couragement, when you compare the piece Ι wrote
oa tlte armaging of Helvidium to the oration of
Demosthenes against Midias, Ι confess Ι had that
speech in my hands when Ι composed mine; not
that Ι pretend to rival it (that would be an excessive
and mad attempt indeed) , but I endeavoured, I own,
to imitate it, as far as the difference of our subjects.
would admit, and as nearly as a genius of the
lowest rank can copy one of the highest. Fare·
well.

To Conuurus

Caluinus Pomro is desirous of your affection, and
he deserves it not only for that reason, but because
he gives you lis! (few, you know, ever demand that
boon without bestowing it). Apart from this, he is
an upright, honest, good-natured man, and modest
almost beyond measure3 if indeed it is possible to
be so.
