To ran Eurnnoa Tamari

Tun city of Sinope is ill supplied, Sir, with water,
which, however, may be brought thither from about
sixteen miles' distance in great plenty and per-
fection. ΤΙιε ground indeed, near the source of this
spring, is for something more than a mile of a very
suspicions and m‘arshy nature3 but I have directed
an examination to be made (which will be done at a
small expense) whether it is capable of bearing any
superstructum. l have taken care to provide a
sufficient fund for this purpose, if you shall approve,
Sir, of a work so conducive to the health and amenity

of this colony, greatly distressed by a scarcity of water.
