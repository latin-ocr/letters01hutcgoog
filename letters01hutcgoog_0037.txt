BOOK VII. ix

I know your main bent at present is towards
forensic oratory3 but l would not for that reason
advise you always to wield the controversial and, so
to say, militant pen. As landis improved by sowing

by men of leisure), but those little witty pieces
which serve as proper reliefs to every degree of care

nature3 and 'indeed (for while l am exhorting you to
poetry, why should Ι not be poetical myself ?)

So, wisely ductile, should man’s reasoning part
Beceive the impress of each various art.”

men as well, used either to exercise or amuse them-
