BOOK X. horim-lxxx

The Censors elect having desired my sentiments
upon this point, Ι was of opinion that, taking the
law of Pompey and the edict of Augustus together,
those who had held a magistracy before the ageos
thirty, might he admitted into the senate3 because
the edict allows the office of magistrate to be
undertaken before thirty; and the law declares,
that whoever has heen a magistrate, has a right to
be a senator. But with respect to those who never
held a magistracy, though they were of- the age
required for that purpose, 1 had some doubt; and
therefore, Sir, Ι apply to you for your directions, Ι
have annexed to this letter sections of the law,
together with the edict of Augustus.

Ι rossa with you, my dear Pliny, in your
construction and arn of opinion that the law of
Pompey isso far repealed by the edict of the
Emperor Augustus that those persons who are not
less than twenty-two years of age may hold the
office of magistrate, and when they have, may be
recei d‘into the senate of their respective cities.
But ΙΙΙΜΙΙ( those who are under thirty years of age,
and hsy'e not held the office of magistrate, cannot,
upon pretence that in point of years they might
have dhne so, claim a place in the senate of their
several communities.
