BOOK Vll. ix

astertheir manner, and at the same time, things
which you might 11111 overlooked in reading cannot

much of an author at once, as to cany in your head
his subject and argument, to tum, 11 11 were, his
rival, and write something on the same¹ topic; then
compare your performance and his, and minutely

succeeded. lt will be a matter 01 very pleasing
congratulation to yourself, if you shall find that in
some things you have the advantage 01 him, 1111

you iu all.

Such a contest is, indeed, something bold; but as it
posses in secret, it cannot be taxed with presumptiou.

no longer fresh iu your memory, you may revise it;
retaining several things but rejecting still more3

lt is 1 laborious and tedious task, 1 own, thus to
re-enflame the mind aster the first heat is over, to
recover an impulse when its force has been checked
and spent, in a word, to interweave new parts into
the texture of 1 composition without disturhing or
coulounding the original plan; but the very difficulty

l ol this method renders it a profitable one.
