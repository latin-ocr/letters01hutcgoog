BOOK Vlll. xxiii

less pleasing and acceptable, than useful, to the
several Consuls he served under! With what energy
and vigilance did he canvass for this very aedileship,
from which heis now prematurely snatched-a cir-
cumstance that intensely aggravates my grief!

His wasted la‘bours, his fruitless solicitations, and
the office which he only merited, never enjoyed, are
ever in my mind's eye: Thatmemorable investiture
of the laticlave under my roof3 the first and the last
occasions of my supporting his candidature; the
conversations we have had, and the consultations we
have held, all return fresh upon my mind. Ι am
affected by his own youth, and the misfortune of his
family. He had an aged parent; a wife, who was¹
his virgin bride only a year ag03 a daughter, whom
he had only lately given a father's first embrace :a so
many pleasing hopeS, so many tendcr joys, were all
reversed and destroyed in one day! When he was
just elected aedile3 when he was lately commenced
husband and father, he had to leave his office
untasted, his mother childlesS, his wife a widow, his
daughter a mere infant, never to know a father's
love.

But what increases my tears upon this melancholy
occasion is that, being absent and unconscious of the
impending stroke, Ι never knew of his siekneSS, till
l heard of his death, and had no time to prepare
myself for this cruel blow, by previously apprehend-
ing it! Such· is the distress of my mind as Ι
communicate these tidings You must not wonder
then that they are the whole subject of my letter;

for l am not able at present to think or talk of any-
thing else. Farewell.
