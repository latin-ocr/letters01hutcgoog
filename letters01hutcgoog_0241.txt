BOOK IX. xxi-xxii

Ι know you are angry with him, and l know too, it
is not without reason; but clemency can never exert
itself with more applause, than when there is the
justest cause for resentment. You once had an ·
affection for this man, and, Ι hope, will have again:
in the meanwhile, let me only prevail with you to
pardon him. lf he should incur your displeasure
hereafter, you will have so much the stronger plea
in excuse for your anger, as you shew yourself more
exorable to him now. Allow something to his youth,
to his tears, and to your own natural mildness of
temper: do not make him uneasy any longer, and Ι
will add too, do not make yourself so ; for a man of
your benevolence of heart cannot be angry without
feeling great nneasiness.

l am afraid, were Ito join my entreaties with his,
Ι should seem rather to compel, than request you to
forgive him. Yet 1 will not scruple to do it ; and so

‘much the more fully and freely as 1 have very
sharply and severely reproved him, positively threat-
ening never to interpose again in his behalf. But
though it was proper to say this to him, in order to
make him more fearful of offending‚ I do not say it
to you. l may, perhapS, again have occasion to
intreat you upon his account, and again obtain your
forgiveness; supposing,1 mean, his error should be
such as may become me to intercede for, and you to
pardon. Farewell.
