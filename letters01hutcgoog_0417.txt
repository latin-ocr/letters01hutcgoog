To ‘ruis Euruuoa Taumu

Surrourvs Tusuouuius Sir, is a person of great
merit and learning, as well as of noble birth. l was
so much pleased with his turn and manners that Ι
long since made him one of my intimates3 and my
affection for him still increased the more I discovered
of his character. Two reasons concur to make the
privilege which the law grants to those who have
three childreu,“ extremely necessary to him; he is
legatee¹ to several of his friends,l’ and has had ill
success in his marriage. Those advantages therefore
which nature has denied to him, he hopes to obtain
from your goodness, by means of my intercession.
l am thoroughly sensible, Sir, of the value of the
favour I am asking; but I know I am making this
request to one whose gracious compliance with
all my desires I hav'e amply experienced. How
passionately Ι wish to obtain this favour, you will
judge hy my thus requesting it in my absence, which
I should not have done, had it been a point wherein
Ι am only commonly solicitous

lBy the Lex Papa Pogmaea (vii. 16, note) childless
persons forfeited one half of every legacy they received.
