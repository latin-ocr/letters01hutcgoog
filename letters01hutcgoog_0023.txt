myself to things of this nature, Ι jotted down in
almost no time the following lines upon the subject
which had prompted me to compose :-

“ When Gallus 1 read, who pretends that his sire

Had far more than Tully poetical lire,

The wisest of men, Ι perceived‚ held it fit

To temper his wisdom with love and with wit ;

For Tully, grave Tully, in amorous strainS,

Of the frauds of his paramour Tiro complains,

That faithless to love, and to pleasure untrue,

From his promis’d embrace the arch wauton with-
drew.

Then said Ι to my beart, Why shouldst thou
conceal

The swectcst of passione, the love which you feel?

Yes, fly wauton Musc, and proclaim it around,

'Thy Pliny has lov’d, and his Tiro has found 3

The coy one so artful, who sweetly denieS,

And from the soit flame, but to heighten it, dies.'’

From this 1 turned to an elegiae poem, which Ι
finished as rapidly; and yielding to the temptation
of facility‚I added other verses. At my return to
Rome Ι read my performances to some of my friends,
who were pleased to approve of them. Asterwards
whenever l had leisure‚ and particularly when Ι
travelled, l made attempts in several metres. At
length l determined‚ after the example of many
others, to complete for publication a separate volume
of erotic poems3 and l have no reason to repent of
my resolution. They are much the mode, copies are in

everybody's hands; they are even sung to harp or lyre
