BOOK VIII. xvii

which seems invited and detained by the villas
upon its banks, has destroyed and carried away κ
much of the woods that shade its brink. It has
undermined mountainS‚ and its charmel being
blocked by the resulting landslideS, it has wrecked
houses in the endeavour to regain its course, and
surges high above the ruins

Dwellers in the uplands who were out of reach of
this fearful inundation, have seen, here the household
gear and heavy furniture of lordly mansions, there -
instruments of husbandry, elsewhere ploughs and
oxen with their drivers, elsewhere again herds of
cattle let loose and astray‚ together with trunks of

trees, or beams and gables of the neighbouring villas
-all floating about far and wide. Nor indeed have

even these uplandS, to which the river did not
u'se, escaped calamity. For long torrentia] rainS,
and waterspouts hurled down from the clouds, have
destroyed all the enclosures on the valuable farms‚
and shaken, and even overtumed, public buildings. ,
Numbers have been maimed, crushed, or boried by
such accidentS, and loss of property has been
aggravated by bereavements.

l am extremely oneasy lest this extensive· disaster
should have spread to you; I beg therefore, if it has
not, you will immediately relieve my anxiety.
And indeed, 1 desire you would inform me though ,
it should; for there is little difference between
expecting misfortune and undergoing it; except
that grief has limits, whereas apprehension has
none. For we grieve only for what we know has
happened3 but we sear all that possibly may huppen.
Farewell.
