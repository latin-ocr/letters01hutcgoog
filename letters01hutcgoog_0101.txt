Α BOOK Vll. xxxi

We served in the army together, and I had a
rearer view of his character, than merely what his
eing my comrade gave me. He commanded a
livision of horse, when 1 was appointed by the
onsular Legate to examine the accounts of the
avalry and the cohorts;⁰ and as 1 found disgusting

apacity and corresponding neglect in some cilicem,
u l found the highest integrity and exactest care in
lim. He was afterwards promoted to high adminis-
tative offices3 yet no temptations could turn
side the innate bias of his soul from honesty,
ro prosperity swell his breast; he preserved in all
he variety of posta through which he passed, an
mhroken reputation of humaniiy3 and discharged
lis toilsome duties in the same resolved spirit as he
low supports his want of occupatiori. He once
ndeed quitted his retirement for a short interval,
aith great applause, being chosen 'by our friend
lorellius as his coadjutor in purchasing and allotting
ands under the benefaction of the Emperor Nervas'
lnd could there be a greater honour than to be
elected by so eminent a man, who had, moreover‚
uch an extensive range of choice?

Yon may believe how faithfully he reveres the ties
rs friendship, from the dying testimony of many
rersons,⁶ including that most respectable citizen,
lunius Bassus, Pollio (who venerates letters as
vell as every other valuable art) keeps alive, and
rpreads, the memory of Bassus hythe most grateful
rulogy‚ insomuch that he has published a memoir of
rim. A line action, and the ,more commendable
from its very uncommonness since men in general
confine their recollection of the dead to what they
ran complain about.
