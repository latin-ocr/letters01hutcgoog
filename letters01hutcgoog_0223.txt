BOOK IX. xiii

Fannia ought not to be denied the privilege of
laying their grievances before the house; and that
the point to be considered was not the rank of
the person, but the merit of the causet Cornutus
told the house, that as he was appointed guardian

to the daughter of Helvidius by the consuls, upon
the petition of her· mother ‘and her step-father,
he could not bring himself to abandon the duty
of his trust on this occasion. In fulfilling it, how-
ever, he would restrain his personal indignation, and
report the extremely moderate sentiments of those
excellent ladies They desired no more, he said,
than to bring to the Senate’s notice the bloodshed
which Certus procured in his obsequiousnessss’ with
the request that, if the legal penalty of his notorious
crime were remitted, at least Certus might be
branded with some disgrace equivalent to degradation
by the Consors.⁶ Satrius Rufus then expressed
himself in neutral and ambiguous terms. “ l am of
opinion,'’ said he, “that injustice will be done to
Certus, if heis not acquitted (1 do not scruple to'
name him, since the friends of Arria and Fannia, as
well as his own, have done so). Nor has the Senate
ledffllllfalss‘tillllljulgele’rlhie libid
(as Ι hope and wislr, and till something be proved
against him, shall believe he is), it will be in your
power to aequit him.'’

Thus they delivered their several opinions, in the
order in which they were called upon. When it carne
to my turn, l rose up, and using the same exordium as
appears in the published speech, I replied to them

and he might bo induced to degrada Certus ii the senate
expressed condemnation of him. (Merrill.)
