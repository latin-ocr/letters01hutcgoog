state upon what grounds, For Ι wish not only that

you may approve, but that my fellow coheirs may
excuse me, for having in ohedience to a higher duty,
separated my interest from theirs.

:· 1 have the highest esteem for Corellia, both as the
sister of Corellius Rufus, whose memory is most

-sacred to me, and as she was an intimate friend os
ny mother's Resides, Ι am bound by a long—stand-
ng friendship to her husband, the excellent Minicius

'. ustus; asl was by a very close one to her son; so
w ruch so, that I lixed upon him to preside at the
·mes which Ι exhibited 'as Praetor. This lady,
,a hen Ι was last in your vicinity, expressed a wish to
χ, ossess something¹ upon our lake of Comum; Ι made ·
ga er an offer, at her own price, of any part of rny

¹ state there, except what came to me from my
‘rather and mother; for that Ι could not resign, even
,to Corellia. So, when the inheritance which com-
prised farms in that district fell to me, Ι wrote to
acquaint her it was to be sold. This letter Ι sent by
Hennes who upon her requesting him that he would
immediately let her have my proportion of the
estate, consented to do so.

You see how fully I ought to confirm what my
freedman has done agreeably to my inclinatiora. lt
only remains to wish my sellow-coheirs may not
take it amisa, that Ι sold what Ι was at
liberty not to sell at all. They are under no
necessity of following my example, since they have
not the same connexione with Corellia that Ι have.
They are free, therefore, to be guided by aelf-interest,
{motive in my own case supplanted by friendship.
