BIOGRAPHICAL INDEX

the Vitellians won the day at
Betriacum, his beaten and des-
perate soldiers, aiter once more
importuning him to claim the
huicine, actually demanded his
death nom its new master. But
Vitellius, to his, credit, took
ains to eave him (Tacitus
ht. 11. 68). Havlny weathered
these storms, Verginius lived
honoured and prosperous under
the three Flavinn umperors;
it, as Pliny seems to imply
(11. 1), he was suspected and

disliked by Vespasian and D*
mitian, neither attempted
molest him. He was tlu
consul; firstly in ¹⁴⁸3 11). uada
Nero; secondly in d9 an. undet
0th0; thirdly ln 97 an. the
year othls death, when hierva
made him hie colleague in that
offlce. Pliny is better inspired
than usual when hc declares
(11. 1) that to have hie funeral
eulogy pronounced by Tacitus
set the occing-stone upon the*
good luck ol Verginius.
