Tur pleasure and attention with which you read
my booksI On tlte Avenging of Helvidius, has made
you, it seemS, more eamest in requesting I would

relevant to, my work, and, in short, of the whole
course of the affair, as you were too young to
witness it. .

When Domitian was killed,⁶ I judged, on mature
consideration, that a glorious opportunity now offered
of pursuing the guilty, vindicating the injured, and
advancing one’s own career. Further, amidst the
many crimes whereof many had been guilty, none
appeared to me more atrocious, than that one who
was at once an ex-praetor and a judge, a senator,
should in the very senate itself have laid violent hands
upon a senator and err-consul, who then stood arraigned
before him. Apart'from this, l had maintained with
Helvidius the closest friendship that was possible
with one who, fearing the tyranny of the times,
endeavoured to hide hIs glory and his no less glorious
virtueS, by a retired life. l had been intimate, too,
with Arria and her daughter Fannia,⁰ who was step-
mother to Helvidius. But it was not so much private
attachments as the rights of the public, indignation
at the crime, and the importance of establishIng
a precedent, that incited me to action.
