BOOK Vlll. xiv

that it was impossible to put them to the vote
otherwise than separately. For what is there in
common between a sentence of banishment, and a
sentence of death? Nothing more, heaven known
than there is between a sentence of banishment and
an acquittal. (Alheit acquitting a person comes

much nearer to banishing him, than does sentencing
him to death; for both the former verdicts spare,
whereas the latter takes away, his life.) ln the
meanwhile, those respectively in favour of death, and
of banishment, sate together on the same side of the
House: and by a temporary appearance of union,
suspended their real disagreement. Ι demanded,
that the three verdicts should be counted as three,
and that two of thern should not coalesce by a
momentary truce3 consequently, Ι insisted that
members who were for capital punishment should
move awayff from the proposer of banishment; and
that those who would shortly be at variance should
not meanwhile group themselves in opposition to the
party foracquittal, merely to disunite again ; for it was
not material that they all opposed the same motion,
since they did not support the same. It also seemed
to me very extraordinary that whereas he who
proposed banishment l'or freedmen and death for
the slaves was obliged to put two distinct motions'
to the House; the proposer of a death-sentence upon
the freedmen should be reekoned along with him
who proposed to banish thern. ‘ For if one and the
same senator’s motion had to be divided, because
it comprehended two distinct things, Ι could not
see how the motions of two different persons, whose
views were diametrically opposed, could be taken
together.
