especially that of the king hImself, to the harmony

of Grecian number. There is nothing, however, so
hard that art and industry cannot at least mitigate,
if not absolutely subdue. Besides, if Homer is
allowed to contract or lengthen, or change even
Grecian names, and those, too, nothing harsh to the
ear, in order to make them run more smoothly in his
verse ; why should the same licence be forbidden to
you, especially since it springs from necessity and
not affectation? Come onthen, my friend, and after
having, in right of your bardship, iuvoked the gods,
and among the rest that dIvine bero whose deeds,
works, and counsels you are going to celebrate,
loosen all your cordage, spread every sail, and now,
if ever, give free course to your genius-for you
must allow meto be poetical too, when I am talking
toa ›oetl
Arld now I insist that you send me every part,
κ as soon as it has received your last finishing touches3
l nay before, while it is in its first rough and embryonic
state. 'You will tell me, that excerpts cannot pleasc
like one entire piece, nor a sketch like a completcd
design. I am very sensible of that and therefore
shall judge your work as an essay only, and survey
Pii, as so many disjoined members; and shall faith-
sully lay it up in my scrutoire, to wait your last hand.
Indulge me then with this additional pledge of your
affection, that you let me into a secret you would
wish kept from everybody. In fine I may possibly ·
admire and applaud your poems the more highly,
the more tardy and cautious you are in communica-
ting them; but the more quickly and heedlessly
you do so, the more I shall love and applaud the
poet himself. Farewell.
