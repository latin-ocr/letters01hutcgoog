But though I owed him no return, nor what I
might call reciprocity of good offices ; yet not only
the beauty of his extensive genius, as polite as it is
severely correct, but the diguIty of his subject, would
sorcibly invite my attendanee. ‘He has written an
account of the deaths of several illustrious personS,
some of whom were my dear friends. It is a pious
office, methinks, as I could not be present at their
obsequies, to attend this (as I may call it) their
funeral oration; which though alate, is however for
that reason a more genuine tribute to their memories,
Farewell. “

To Gemmas

I nucu approve of your having read my orations
with your father. It is important for your progresS,
to learn from a man of his eloquence what to admire
and what to condemn, and by the same course of
traiuing to acquire the habit of speaking your real
sentimenta. You see whose steps you ought to ·
follow 3 and happy are you in having a living model
before you, which is at once the nearest and the
noblest you can pursue! Happy, in a word, that he
whom nature designed you should most resemble, is,
of all otherS, the person whom you should most
imitate! Farewell.
