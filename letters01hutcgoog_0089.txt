md spacious, but ill-reputed and pestilential house.
ln the dead of the night a noise, resembling the
clashing of iron, was frequently heard, which, if
you listened more attentively, sounded like the
rattling of fetters; at first it seemed at a distance,
hut approached nearer by degrees; immediately
afterward a phantom appeared in the form of an
old man, extremely meagre and squalid, with a long
beard and bristling hair, rattling the gyves on his
leet and hands. The poor inhabitants consequently
passed sleepless nights under the most dismal
terrors imaginable. This, as it broke their rest,
threw them into distemperS, which, as their horrors
of mind increased, proved in the end fatal to their
lives. For even in the day time, though the spectre
did not appear, yet the remembrance of it made such
astrong impression upon their imaginations that it
still seemed before their eyes, and their terror
remained when the cause of it was gone. By this
means the house was at last deserted, as being
judged by everybody to be absolutely uninhabitable;
so that it was now entirely abandoned to the ghost.
However, in hopes that some tenant might be found
who was ignorant of this great calamity which
attended it, a bill was put up, giving notice that it
was either to be let or sold.

It happened that Athenodorus the philosophera
came to Athens at this time, and reading the bill·
ascertained the price. The extraordinary cheapness
raised his suspicion; nevertheless, when he heard
the whole story, he was so far from being dis-
ctouragied, thglt he was rplpre 'dstgongly ll⁷llinedtto hire
