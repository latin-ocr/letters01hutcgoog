Ι Το run Eurnnon Tarum

J unius Laneus, Sir, ο1 Pontus, though l never yet
saw, nor indeed, even heard of him (to be sure, he
relied on your testimonial α), has intrusted me with
the administration, so to speak, of his loyal sentiments
towards you. He has desired me in his will to take
formal possession of his estate, aud, after deducting
50,000 sesterces for my own use, to make over the
remainder to the cities of Heraclea and Tium, condi-
tionally upon their either erecting some public edifice
in your honour, or instituting Athletic games, to be
celebrated every live years, and called Trojan’a gamer,
according as Ι shall determine. 01 this l thought
it necessary to acquaint you; and for this reason
chiefly, that you may decide which alternative l
should choose.
