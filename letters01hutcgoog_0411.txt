To run Euruuon Tuarurv

N vururnrus Lupus, Sir, formerly a chief centurion,
was my comrade in arms3 he was prefacta at the
same time that Ι was military tribune: and it was
from thence my affection for him began. A long
acquaintance hath since mutually endeared and
strengthened our friendship. For this reason Ι did
violence to his repose, and insisted upon his attend·
ing me in Bithynia, as my assessor in council. He
most readily granted me this proof of his friendship;
and without any regard to the plea of age, or the
ease of retirement, he has shared with me the fatigue .
of business3 and upon all occasions is still ready to
give me his assistance. I look upon his relations
therefore as my own; in which number Nymphidius
LupuS, his son, claims my particular notice. He is a
youth of great merit and indefatigable applicati0n;
and in every view of his character, well worth of so
excellent a father. That he is equal to any llonour
you shall think proper tu confer upon him, the early
proof he gave of his qualifications will easily convince
you; as his conduct as prefect of a cohort gained
him the full applause of those most illustrious per-
sonages, Julius Ferox, aud Fuscus Salinator. And I
will add, Sir, that any increase of dignity which
he shall receive, will bean occasion of particular
congratulation to myself.
