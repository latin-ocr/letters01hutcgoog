farms upon long leases. l am obliged to enter upon
an entire new method with my tenants: for during
the last five yearS, though l made them very con-
siderable abatementS, they have run greatly in arrear. ’
For this reason several of thern not only take no sort
os care to lessen a debt, which they despaired os
paying in full; but even seiae and consume all the
produce of the lands, in the belief that it would now
be no advantage to themselves to spare it.

lmust therefore obviate this increasing evil, and
endeavour to find out some remedy against it. The
only one l can think of is, not to let ata money-rent,
but on condition of receiving a fixed share of the
produce; and theuto place some of my servants to
overlook the tillage, and to keep a vvatch 011 the crops.
And indeed, there is no sort of revenue more equit-
able, than what arises from the bounty of the soil,
the seasons and the climate. ’Tis true, this method
will require great integrity and diligent attendance
in the person 1 appoint my bailiff, and put me to the
expense os employing many hands. However, 1
must hazard the experiment3 and, as in an inveterate
distemper, try every change of remedy.

You see, it is not any pleasurable indulgence, that

prevents my attending you on the first day of your
consulship. l shall celebrate it nevertheless as
much as if l were present, and pay my vows for you
here, with all the warmest sentiments of joy and
congratulation. Farewell.
