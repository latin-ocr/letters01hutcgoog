Το rus Enrsaos Tarsis

Tus citizens of Nicomedia, Sir, have expended
three million three hundred and twenty-nine thousand
sesterces“ on an aqueduct; but they abandoned
it unfinished, and it has actually been pulled down.
They made a grant of two hundred thousand
sesterces for another aqueduct, but this likewise is
discontinued; so that after having thrown away an
immense sum they must incur fresh expense in order
to be accommodated with water. l have personally
visited a most limpid spring from whence the watei
may be conveyed over archesi (as was done in their
first design), so as not to reach only the level and
low parts of the city. Τ here are but very few arches
remaining3 others can be erected with the square
blocks of stone which have been pulled down from
the former work; some part, 1 think, may be built
of brick,⁶ as that will be the easier and cheaper
method. But first, to prevent another failure, it
will be necessary for you to send here an inspector
of aqueducts or an engineer. Ι will venture to
affirm one thing-the beauty and usefulness of the
work will be entirely worthy of your reign.

a concrete core, as was also the lapis quadratus just rnen·
