BOOK VII. i.-ii

my physician offered me something to drink3 Ι put
out my hand, bade him feel my pulse, and returned
the cup, though it was just at my lips Afterwards,
when 1 was preparing to go into the bath, twenty
lays from the first attack of my illneSS, perceiving
n a sudden the physicians whispering together, 1
nquired what they were saying. They replied, Ι
right possibly bathe with safety, however, they were
ot without some suspicion of hazard. “What
seed,” said l, “of doing it at all?” And thus,
vith great complacency, Ι gave up the expected
pleasure of bathing, and abstained from the bath
'vith the same inward and outward composure 1 was Ι
:oing to enter it. 1 mention this, not only in order
‚o enforce my advice by example, but also that this
letter may be a sort of pledge binding me to
persevere .in the same abstinence for the future.
Farewell.

Το Jusrus

ἦ· Anu you not inconsistent with yourself, when you
assure me you have no intermission from businesS,
rnd yet at the same time express an earnest desire
to see my works3 upon which even the idle will
scarce bestow some of their useless hours? 1 will
not then break in upon your affairs during this busy
summer seas0n; but when the return of winter shall
nahe it reasonable to suppose that your eveningS,
at least, may be disengaged, Ι will look over my
trilles for something worth showing you. ln the
meanwhile, 1 shall be well satisfied, if my letters are
not troublesome, as Ι suspect they are, and therefore
shorten them. Farewell.
