BOOK Vll. xxvii

This story Ι believe upon the affirmation of
›thers3 Ι can myself affirm to others what Ι now
elate. Ι have a freed-man named Marcus, who
ras some tincture of lettera. One night, his
younger brother, who was sleeping in the same bed
with him, saw, as he thought, somebody sitting on
lhe couch, who put a pair of shears to his head,
ind actually cut off the hair from the very crown of
it. When morning came, they found the boy’s
crown was shorn, and the hair lay scattered about
on the floor. After a short interval, a similar
occurrence gave creditto the former. A slave-boy
of mine was sleeping amidst several others in their
quarterS, when two persons clad in white came iu
(as he tells the story) through the windowS, cut off his
hair as he lay, aud withdrew the same way they
entered. Daylight revealed that this boy too had
been shoru, and that his hair was likewise spread
about the room. Nothing remarkable followed,
unless it were that Ι escaped prosecution; pro-
secuted Ι should have been, if Domitian (in whose
reign these things happened) had lived longer.
For an information lodged by Carasa against me
was found iu his scrutere. Hence it may be con-
jectured, since it is customary for accused persons
to let their bair grow, that this cutting of my servants’
hair was a sign Ι should defeat the peril that hung
over me.

Ι beg, then, you will apply learning to this
question. lt merits your prolonged and profound
considerati0n3 and Ι arn not myself an unworthy
recipient of your abounding knowledge. And though
you should, alter your manner, argue on both sides ;
