state upon what grounds¹ For Ι wish not only that
you may approve, but that my fellow coheirs may
excuse me, for having in obedience to a higher duty,
separated my interest from theirs.
ἶ Ι have the highest esteem for Corellia, both as the
sister of Corellius Rufus, whose memory is most
”sacred to me, and as she was an intimate friend of
ny mother's. Resides l am bound by a long—stand-

Il ustus3 asl was bya very close one to her son; so
a luch so, that l fixed upon him to preside at the
’ mes which I exhibited 'as Praetor. This lady,
hen Ι was last in your vicinity‚ expressed a wish to
y ossess something upon our lake of Comum; l made ·

Ι, ther and mother; for that Ι could not resign, even
,to Corellia. Sc, when the inheritance which com-

acquaint her it was to be sold. This letter l sent by
Hermes, who upon her requesting him that he would
immediately let her have my proportion of the
estate, consented to do so.

freedman has done agreeably to my inclinations. lt
only remains to wish my follow-coheirs may not
take it amiss, that l sold what l was at
liberty not to sell at all.¹ They are under no
necessity of following my example, since they have
not the same connexions with Corellia that l have.
They are free, therefore, to be guided by sels-interest,
