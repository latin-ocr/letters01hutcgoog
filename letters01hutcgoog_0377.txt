By this means we shall not only secure the lake from
being drained by union with the river, but all the
{bertillis ll l? insilii} ‘lays litt&
over that little intervening ridge whatever burdens
shall be brought down hythe canal.

This is a scheme which may be pursued, if it
should be found necessary ; but 1 hope there will be
no occasion to put it into practice. For the lake
itself is pretty deep, and as it is, a river runs out of
it on the opposite side3 by damming this up, and
diverting it in whatever direction we please, we can
ensure its sending out the same quantity of water as
it now conveys‚ without any diminution of the lake.⁰
Besides, there are several little brooks along the pro-
posed course of the canal which, if carefully collected,
will augment the supply of water from the lake. But
if we should rather approve of the canal’s being
extended further, and cut narrower,l so as to reach
sea-level, and run not into the river but direct into
the sea, the reflux of the tide will make good and
check the discharge from the lake.

After all, if the nature of the place should not
admit of any of these schemeS, the course of the
water may be easily regulated by sluices. These,
however, and other particulars, will he more skilfully
examined into by the, engineer, whom, agreeably to
your promise, l am sure you will send; for indeed,
Sir, it is an enterprise well worthy of your attention

and magnificence. ln the meanwhile l have wrote
