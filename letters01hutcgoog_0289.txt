BOOK IX. xl

1 meditate upon what I have dictated, and by often
revising it in my own mind, fix it in my memory.
Thus l have given you my scheme of life in summer
and winter ; to which you may add the intermediate
seasons ol' spring and autumn. As at those times 1
lose nothing of the day, so Ι steal but little from the
night. F arewell.
