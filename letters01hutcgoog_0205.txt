BOOK IX. vi.-vii

cheap tunic ll—never mind it with the vulgar herd,
who are more worthless than the tunics they wear—
but with certain grave personageS. When Ι observe
such men thus insatiably fond of so silly, so low,⁸
so uninteresting, so common an entertainment, Ι
congratulate mysels that Ι am insensible to these
pleasures: andam glad to devote the leisure of this
season to literature, which others throw away upon
the most idle employment. Farewell.

Vll
To Ronanus

Youa letter informs me that you are engaged in
building; 'tis mighty well; Ι have now found
patronage3 for I am doing the same, and since Ι
have you, who shall deny Ι have reason on my side?
We are pretty much agreed likewise, I find, in our
situations3 as you are building upon the sea-coast,
and I beside the Larian lake.

Ι have several villas upon this shore, but there are
two particularly, in which as l take most delight, so
they give me the most employment. They are
both situated in the manner of those at Baiae ; one
of them stands upon a rock, and overlooks the lake ;
the other touches it. The first, supported as it were
by the lpsty buskin, Ι call my Tragedy3 the other,
as testing upon the humble sock, my Comedp. Each
has its peculiar beauties, and recommends itself the
more to their owner by mere force of contrast. The
former enjoys a wider, the lattera nearer prospect of

factione, and had frantia partisana arnon all classes.

Caligula and Nero were devotees ol the “dardana'' See
Gibbon‚ c. xl. 2.
