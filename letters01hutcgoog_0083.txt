BOOK Vll. xxv

are going to speak or recite in public, it is only
the men who parade their studies that we are afraid
of; whereas in truth, those who say nothing about
them have so much a higher claim to regard, as they

pay the homage of silence to the noblest of em-
ployments. These observations l give you upon
experience.

Terentius Junior, having blamelessly passed
through the military posts ’ belonging to the
Equestrian orderv and held that of Procurator in
Narbonensian Gaul, retired to his estates, preferring
an uninterruptedleisure to the offices that awaited
him. He invited me lately to his house; looking
upon him only as a worthy father of a family and an
industrious sarmer, l meditated such topics as l
imagined him versed in; but l no sooner began,
than he led me back to professional subjects by his
cultured conversation. How pithy his every re-
mark! How pure his Latin and his Greek! For

;he is so perfectly master of both languages that
whichever he uses at the moment seems to be the
one wherein he particularly excels. How extensive
is his reading! how tenacious his memory! You
would think the man lived in Athens, instead of at
a farm-house.

To be short with you, Terentius has augmented
my solicitude and taught me to fear these retired
and so to speak rustic gentry, no less than the
most cultivated menl know. l advise you todo the
same, for, believe me, upon a careful observation,
you will osten find in the literary as well as military
world, most formidable abilities concealed under a
very rustical appearance. Farewell.
